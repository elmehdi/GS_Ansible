ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping
# the -m is for module, there is types of modules
# allo us to make sure that every thing is working : ansible was able to connect to each server and establish connection
# -i : inventory file 
# PFF : I have now git ssh problems, WHY !? : because of the session, different ssh agents
#  
# we want to actually automate everything : 500 servers ! :
# shorten that command and create an ansible config file

ansible all --list-hosts 
ansible all -m gather_facts : for plenty of information
ansible all -m gather_facts --limit host IP@
