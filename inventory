# As I'm using cloud servers provided by the a cloud guru labs, the IP addresses change every 4 hours, but the content on the servers stays intact. => I NEED TO UPDATE THIS FILE EACH TIME WITH THE NEW IP @s

#I need to check if the hostnames change, if not use them instead
# I put them in categories, because I discovered that tha ansible ad-hoc commands are not the same for the same repostories, there will different commands, and also because they have different passwords and the command only asks for 1 password so if I type the password of one of them, one will succeed and the others fail

#UPDATE : the hostnames don't change >> using them instead
